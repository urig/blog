Hello and welcome to my software development blog. 

My name is Uri Goldstein and I've been programming computers since about 1985. I've worked as a programmer, a team leader, a consultant and a university lecturer. I've worked in organizations big (~250k people) and small (4 guys around a big table) and both for product organizations and project companies.

In this blog I share what I'm learning on my on-going journey through tech. Mostly that includes C#, Python, Java, TypeScript, Angular, React, unit testing, test automation, refactoring legacy code, continuous integration and Azure and AWS. You can expect useful code samples, new insights into programming and "post mortems" of mistakes I've made along the way.

Finaly, I am an independent programmer and consultant. If you have a hard problem to solve, an interesting project to build or a team that needs a technical boost, I'd love to hear from you. Please feel free to [email me](mailto:urig@urig.io) or DM me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/urig).


Sincerely,
Uri Goldstein
